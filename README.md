# Joyeux Anniversaire, chère Bonbons ! :smiling_imp:
This is a colorful happy birthday microgame implemented with Unity3D & C# where you play a tiny green monster with a big mouth (!), living in candy land - and your task is to catch as many candies falling down as you can by moving back and forth between left and right screen. 

# Rules of the Game
1. At the beginning you own three lives (indicated by three hearty hearts :purple_heart: in the top left corner). 
2. Each time you are missing a falling candy you lose on of those lives.
3. In the top right corner your score is shown - at the beginning of the game it is zero.
4. If you manage to catch a candy you are awarded one point, your score increases by one. 
5. The game is over as soon as you have lost your last live.

# Hint
With a bit of training you can gain scores higher than 2, 3 or even 4. :crown: Good luck, chéries. 

Kudos to Raja Biswas of Charger Games :rocket: for entertaining inspiration!
